## General Info:
This project is for Python/DS Coding Task.

## Introduction:
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset contains around 36000 classified tweets of training and dataset. The trainingset itself has around 7000 tweets which each row is marked as 1 for positive sentiment and 0 for negative sentiment. I tried using this dataset with a very simple Naive Bayesian classification algorithm.

## Goals:
* Show the top-10 most positive words, top-10 negative words (words more frequent with positive and negative labels respectively).
* Plot the frequency of any word (which is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table) using Zipf law.
* Train using simple classifier to predict sentiment.

## Technologies:
Project is created with:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* NLTK

## Dependencies:
see requirements.txt

## How To Use:
* Clone this repository
* Run the .ipynb file with jupyter notebook
